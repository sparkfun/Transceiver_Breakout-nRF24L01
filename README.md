[*SparkFun Transceiver Breakout - nRF24L01+ (WRL-00691)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/691)

This module uses the newest 2.4GHz transceiver from Nordic Semiconductor, the nRF24L01+. 
This transceiver IC operates in the 2.4GHz band and has many new features! 
Take all the coolness of the nRF2401A and add some extra pipelines, buffers, and an auto-retransmit feature - very nice!
